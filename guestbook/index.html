				We feel exceptionally fortunate to have stayed at Riad Romm'an. It's a complete and perfect oasis - a haven from the excitement of Marrakech and I felt very sorry for all the unfortunates who were staying elsewhere! We were treated like royalty by Ismail and Zahra and revelled in Laura and Scott's superb design. A whole 5* home with kind and attentive staff to ourselves - who could ask for more?! <span>Mrs J Colston</spam>

				You have made Riad Romm'an so beautiful in every way … it's just perfect.  It is so peaceful and we have really enjoyed our time there…especially up on the roof terrace. We have spent a lot of time there. So lovely to go up there first thing and enjoy the warm sunshine. We loved Brahim, Zahra and Ismael. They were all wonderful, as was our excellent driver, Lhacen, on our trips to the Zagora and to Kasbah Toubkal.  Food was excellent at the Riad. We have done a lot in the few days and would love to come back again next year. Inshallah.  My parents loved it and my daughters Maisie and Sybie felt the magic of the place too.  The Riad is fantastic for families. <span>Mrs E Ross-Talbott</span>

				Riad Romm'an is even more beautiful than the photos. It is the most perfect place for a holiday in Marrakech. A tranquil haven.<span>Mrs L Cardon</span>
