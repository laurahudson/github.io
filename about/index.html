				The hush of a shadow … the laughter of full light … that cool, quiet rustle in the forest ... a secret hiding place of precious, concrete memories ... a patient flower, seeking warmth on a sunny window-sill … Laura Hudson Mackay's fine art photography captures a mood, a mystique, at once stark & poetic, then lilting & romantic. Her images speak of a cognizance and strong connection with the animate & inanimate world … of harmony, synchronicity & the interplay of form, function and feeling.  <br/><br/>
				Her work has a cosiness and intimacy too, which acts like a heartbeat, an inner voice, calling us to share in her dreamy, visual vignettes. For me, it is audible. I hear her beautiful stories. They are modern and ancient, brooding & playful.</br></br>
				Laura brings life to stilllife, & stillness to a fast and heady world. She knows her subjects well, spending time with them, studying, listening & assessing their intrinsic beauty ... just as a good and committed friend would do.  </br></br>
				Her enchanting photography and this website are where astute craft & deep character converge.<span> Rani Cee  </span>

				Laura Hudson Mackay's photography captures the essence of the lands through which she journeys in the rarest and most wonderful of ways. Through her lens she reaches the raw magical underbelly, which so often escapes travellers<span>Tahir Shah, Author and Filmmaker </span>
